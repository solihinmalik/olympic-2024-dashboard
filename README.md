## 📁 Project Structure

The 2024 Paris Olympics dashboard is a comprehensive web application that visualizes Olympic data to provide actionable insights. It leverages a rich dataset from Kaggle covering athletes, coaches, events, medal results and standings, participating countries (NOCs), schedules, teams, venues, and more (newsdata.io). The goal is to not only display statistics, but to help various stakeholders – from companies to sports organizations and fans – extract useful information and trends from the Olympics.
